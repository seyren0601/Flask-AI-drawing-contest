1. Refactor to new requirements:
- Each submission is assigned to 3 grader:
	+ image grader
	+ video grader
	+ descript grader
-> When there are 3 scores, an assigned submission is considered "graded" -> status = 1

2. BE Authentication:
- When FE calls BE API, they must provide a session_token in request header
- This session token is then matched with user list to find a user with correspond token
-> Get this user group_id
- Implement an authentication layer, which will check for the group_id of each request
- Using that group_id, BE decide whether or not to authorize and proceed with the request
